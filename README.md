# covid19-and-crime
This project applies data visualization to analyze the correlation between COVID-19 and crime types in Essex County. Using Python and GIS, I created charts and heatmaps to depict crime rate changes during the pandemic. These visuals simplified complex crime data, making it comprehensible to a wider audience.
