## covid19-and-crime
This project applies data visualization to analyze the correlation between COVID-19 and crime types in Essex County. Using Python and GIS, I created charts and heatmaps to depict crime rate changes during the pandemic. These visuals simplified complex crime data, making it comprehensible to a wider audience.

## Goals:
The primary objective was to understand how lifestyle changes induced by the pandemic, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures, influenced crime rates.

## My Role:
I was tasked with analyzing and interpreting the data to draw meaningful conclusions about the correlation between the pandemic and crime rates.

## Results:
The insights derived from this study not only shed light on the societal implications of the pandemic but also contributed significantly to our understanding of crime dynamics under extraordinary circumstances. These findings were presented in a manner that was easily comprehensible to a broad audience.
